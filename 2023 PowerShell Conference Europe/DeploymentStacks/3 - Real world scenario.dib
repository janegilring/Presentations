# Real world scenario: Azure Landing Zones deployment

An Azure landing zone architecture is scalable and modular to meet a range of deployment needs. A repeatable infrastructure allows you to consistently apply configurations and controls to every subscription. Modules make it easy to deploy and modify specific components of the Azure landing zone architecture as your requirements evolve.

> NOTE: Since Deployment Stacks do not support deployments to Management Groups during Public Preview, regular deployments are use for those pipeline steps.

## Stack 1 - Management Group hierarchy

- Repository containing ALZ Bicep accelerator deployment using Deployment Stacks: [github.com/janegilring/alzstacksdemo](https://github.com/janegilring/alzstacksdemo)

#!pwsh

Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name 'ALZ-Management-Groups' -ManagementGroupId 'fd91810c-57b4-43e3-b513-c2a81e8d6a27'

#!markdown

## Stack 2 - Logging

- Azure Automation account
- Log Analytics workspace
- Sentinel


### Notes

DenySettingsMode
- DenyWriteAndDelete
    - Added excluded-principal for runbook deploy SPN

#!pwsh

Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name 'ALZ-Logging' -ManagementGroupId 'fd91810c-57b4-43e3-b513-c2a81e8d6a27'

#!pwsh

Set-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name 'ALZ-Logging' -ManagementGroupId 'fd91810c-57b4-43e3-b513-c2a81e8d6a27'

#!markdown

## ApplyToChildScopes

Example using Azure Automation, which have runbooks as child resources

#!pwsh

(Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name 'ALZ-Logging' -ManagementGroupId 'fd91810c-57b4-43e3-b513-c2a81e8d6a27').denySettings

#!markdown

## Stack 3 - Custom Azure Policy Definitions

#!pwsh

Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name 'ALZ-Policies' -ManagementGroupId 'fd91810c-57b4-43e3-b513-c2a81e8d6a27'

#!markdown

## Stack 4 - Connectivity

Networking components
- Hub Virtual Network
- Azure Firewall
- Azure VPN
- Azure ExpressRoute
- Azure Private DNS zones
- and more

#!pwsh

Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name 'ALZ-Connectivity' -ManagementGroupId 'psc-platform-connectivity'

#!markdown

# Deployment

Deployed via GitHub Actions
- Triggers on changes to template files or parameter files

# Gotchas

## Dependencies

Due to dependencies between the stacks, the following error was returned when applying a stack which interacted with the Log Analytics workspace:
```

```

### Solution

Add SPNs object ID to DenySettingsExcludedPrincipals
or
Add action to DenySettingsExcludedActions
