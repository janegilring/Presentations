Nano Server is a new GUI-less Windows Server installation option. However, that doesn't mean you  
need to be a PowerShell expert (althought being one greatly helps) to manage a Nano Server.  
Microsoft has built and enabled a lot of GUI tools to make remote management of Nano Server easier.  
We cover everything you need to know in order to create a Nano Server image using Image Builder,  
and how Recovery Console could help to re-establish remote connectivity. Join us to learn how to  
deploy and use the web-based Server Management Tools (SMT) for remote management and troubleshooting.  
The best part of the story is that demonstrated management tools are applicable to any Windows Server  
installation.
