### Secure Development with Private Endpoints

In enterprise Azure Landing Zones, critical resources are often secured behind private endpoints and virtual networks. DevBox and ADE enable developers to work securely within these boundaries:

#### **Private Endpoint Access Scenarios**

**🔒 Production Resource Access**
- **Challenge**: Production databases, APIs, and services are only accessible via private endpoints
- **Solution**: DevBox VMs deployed within the virtual network can access private endpoints
- **Benefit**: Developers can troubleshoot and develop against real production-like resources securely

**🧪 Pre-Production Testing**
- **Challenge**: Testing environments need realistic data and services with production security
- **Solution**: ADE deploys test environments in pre-prod subscriptions with private endpoint connectivity
- **Benefit**: Realistic testing scenarios without compromising production security

**🏗️ Infrastructure Development**
- **Challenge**: Developing IaC templates requires access to network-isolated resources
- **Solution**: Both DevBox and ADE provide isolated network environments for safe development
- **Benefit**: Iterate on infrastructure changes without affecting production networks

#### **Network Connectivity Patterns**

**DevBox Private Network Integration**
```
